Serial Libraries Communication Samples for [UDOO Board](http://www.udoo.org)

These example’s scripts are meant to demonstrate how to implement a uni\bidirectional communication between an Arduino sketch (running on the Arduino&trade; 101 Intel&reg; Curie&trade; embedded) and a binary application on the Braswell processor running Linux.

The Arduino sketch will remain the same no matter which programming language you’ll use to develop the binary on Linux.

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> The sources could be used also for Windows programs, however the libraries installation and compilation instructions aren't valid.

There are two example scripts for each programming language: C, Java, PHP, Python.

You can find the whole repo in our [Github Channel](https://github.com/UDOOboard/serial_libraries_examples).
Clone the repo in your system using this command on a terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/UDOOboard/serial_libraries_examples.git
    git checkout udoo-x86

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> Make sure the user has the proper permission to read and write from the Arduino&trade; 101 serial device (`/dev/ttyACM0` by default)

Each program is meant to be executed while the matching Arduino Sketch is running on Arduino&trade; 101 Intel&reg; Curie&trade;.

Program the Arduino&trade; embedded with the sketch named `arduino_serial_example.ino` before run these examples:

    c_serial_example.c
    java_serial_example.java
    php_serial_example.php
    python_serial_example.py


Program the Arduino&trade; embedded with the sketch named `arduino_serial_example_bidirectional.ino` before run these examples:

    c_serial_example_bidirectional.c
    java_serial_example_bidirectional.java
    php_serial_example_bidirectional.php
    python_serial_example_bidirectional.py
