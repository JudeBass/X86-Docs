UDOO X86 is a Single Board Computer based on the *N-Series Intel® Pentium® / Celeron® and x5-Series Atom* family of System-on-Chips (SoCs) formerly coded as **Braswell**, a series of Quad Core SoCs with **64-bit instruction set** and very low TDP.

Thanks to the x86_64 instruction set, the **UDOO X86** supports the *Windows* distribution for **32-bit**(aka i386, IA-32, x86-32, x86_32) and **64-bit**(aka x64, x86-64, x86_64).

We suggest to always use a **64-bit** Windows version.

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> Please notice that total amount of 8GB of RAM of the UDOO X86 ULTRA version would be usable only with 64-bit OS. Total amount of memory available with a 32-bit OS depends on the OS itself (less than 4GB, however).

The supported version of Windows are:
* Microsoft® Windows® 7 (32/64 bit)
* Microsoft® Windows® 8.1 (32/64 bit)
* Microsoft® Windows® 10 (32/64 bit)
* Microsoft® Windows® 10 IoT
* Microsoft® Windows® Embedded Standard 7 /8 (32/64 bit)

In the [Getting Started](http://www.udoo.org/get-started-x86/) section you can find a guide of how to install Windows, the example is based on Windows 10 64-bit.

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> The Processors of the UDOO X86  and the Wi-Fi/BT module are released only few time ago so we suggest to use Windows&reg; 10 64-bit to find all the latest drivers already installed and have all the devices operating properly.

In order to download the latest updated versions of the Intel&reg; devices drivers (e.g. Graphics HD drivers, chipset, wireless networking) you can download and run the [Intel® Driver Update Utility](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/24345/Intel-Driver-Update-Utility) for Windows&reg;.
